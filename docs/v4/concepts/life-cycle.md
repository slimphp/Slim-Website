## Application Life Cycle

### 1. Instantiation

First, you instantiate the `Slim\App` class. This is the Slim application object. During instantiation, Slim registers default services for each application dependency.

### 2. Route Definitions

Second, you define routes using the application instance's `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`, `patch()`, `head()`, and `options()` routing methods. These instance methods register a route with the application's Router object. Each routing method returns the Route instance so you can immediately invoke the Route instance's methods to add middleware or assign a name.

### 3. Application Runner

Third, you invoke the application instance's `run()` method. This method starts the following process:

#### A. Enter Middleware Stack

The `run()` method begins to inwardly traverse the application's middleware stack. This is a concentric structure of middleware layers that receive (and optionally manipulate) the Environment, Request, and Response objects before (and after) the Slim application runs. The Slim application is the inner-most layer of the concentric middleware structure. Each middleware layer is invoked inwardly beginning from the outer-most layer.

#### B. Run Application

After the `run()` method reaches the innermost middleware layer, it invokes the application instance and dispatches the current HTTP request to the appropriate application route object. If a route matches the HTTP method and URI, the route's middleware and callable are invoked. If a matching route is not found, the Not Found or Not Allowed handler is invoked.

#### C. Exit Middleware Stack

After the application dispatch process completes, each middleware layer reclaims control outwardly, beginning from the innermost layer.

#### D. Send HTTP Response

After the outermost middleware layer cedes control, the application instance prepares, serializes, and returns the HTTP response. The HTTP response headers are set with PHP's native `header()` method, and the HTTP response body is output to the current output buffer.
