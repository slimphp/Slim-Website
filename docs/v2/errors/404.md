It is an inevitability that someone will request a page that does not exist. The Slim application lets you easily
define a custom Not Found handler with the Slim application’s `notFound()` method. The Not Found handler will be
invoked when a matching route is not found for the current HTTP request. This method acts as both a getter and a setter.

### Set not found handler

If you invoke the Slim application’s `notFound()` method and specify a callable object as its first and only
argument, this method will register the callable object as the Not Found handler. However, the registered handler
will not be invoked.

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->notFound(function () use ($app) {
        $app->render('404.html');
    });

### Invoke not found handler

If you invoke the Slim application’s `notFound()` method without any arguments, this method will invoke the
previously registered Not Found handler.

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->get('/hello/:name', function ($name) use ($app) {
        if ( $name === 'Waldo' ) {
            $app->notFound();
        } else {
            echo "Hello, $name";
        }
    });
